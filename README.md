# JJJ Disc Pack

**For Minecraft Bedrock Edition version 1.21.100 and later**  
***Pack Version 1.1.2***

This addon adds a few vanilla music as music discs. This pack can be used as a template to add more music discs to the game. This pack was inspired by the Edd's More Music Discs addon but no code was directly copied over (it was used as a base on how to structure my own code.)






## Content Added
### Blocks
- New jukebox block that can play the custom discs.

### Items
- Adds 7 vanilla music discs.
- Adds Enchanted Music Disc.

### Loot tables
- Modified vanilla loot tables so that custom discs and vanilla discs can be found in more structures. (These discs are part of the random disc loot, however some discs are not part of this loot and can only be found in specific structures or other aspects of gameplay).
- There is a 1-3% chance for chests to have an Enchanted Music Disc.
- Creepers can drop a selection of the custom discs.
- Creepers have a 5% chance of dropping two music discs.
- Music disc drops on defeating the Ender Dragon for the first time (C418 - Alpha).

### Recipes
- Modified vanilla recipe for jukebox so that it crafts the new jukebox instead.



### Adding new discs
1. Add disc texture in directory 'disc_business_RP/textures/items/jjj_custom_discs'. Preferably 16x16 but other sizes can work.
2. Add OGG Verbose audio file to 'disc_business_RP/sounds/music/game/records'.
3. In the root folder fine and run 'add_new_disc.py'.
4. Follow command line instructions.

After confirming new disc addition the music disc should be ready to use in the pack (or at least that's the intension).
